This is a complete py-file which is part of a larger library. Try to improve its readability
by applying the following principles (if possible):

1. Try to reduce the complexity of nested conditions.
2. Try to shorten methods that are too long by splitting them up into smaller ones.
3. In case if variables inside methods (that only have impact on the part of code we are editing) are named in a bad way, rename them.
4. Add a docstring for every method and add a comment to every line of code.
5. Ensure that code modifications are wrapped in Markdown's python code block syntax:

```python
    ...some python code...
```

6. Do not rename the name of the function or method itself. Only rename variables that are defined inside the method or function. If you
rename anything, make sure that the scope does not extend to other parts of the code.
7. Most importantly, ensure that these changes do not break integration with the larger library.
8. Do not add any 'import' statements in your response. This also means that you must not add any new functionalities
to the code that depend on such 'import' statements.
9. Do not create new classes or rename old ones. Only edit existing ones if needed.
